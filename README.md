# go.mgofdc.org

A small URL redirect setup using [Netlify][netlify-redirects-docs]. This provides us with long-lasting URLs that are separate from the [mgofdc.org] website, such as those needed for the QR codes at the Ellington Arboretum.

Tyson Gach is the maintainer and keeps the Netlify account.
